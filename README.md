# AVIA-The AI Classroom Assistant

## Project Overview
The AI classroom assistant is an inovative tool to help students improve and analyse their performance using AI, providing features like doubt solving, quizzes and assessments and customized feedbacks.
Simultaneously lets teachers upload content/notes and see the doubts asked by the students and thier quiz reports.

This project lets the teachers log into their accounts and upload the contents of the required class and subject. Meanwhile the students can log into their acccounts and ask doubts,attend quizzes and get their scores,corrected answers and weak topics as feedback.It also has a report section which contains a progress graph and list of all the doubts asked.
This report section can be viewed by the teachers as well thus letting the teacher analyse the performance of the class and can get an understanding of what all doubts have been asked.

## Outcomes



## Limitations
* **Limited Feedback Accuracy** :Feedback on weak topics may not always reflect actual
conceptual gaps.
* **No Real-time Interaction** :Lacks live chat or instant help for student doubts during quiz
attempts.
* **Basic Text Input Only** :Currently supports only text-based doubts; no image/audio input
implemented.
* **No Adaptive Learning** :The system doesnâ€™t personalize quiz difficulty based on past
student behavior.
* **Subject Input Sensitivity** :Student and teacher inputs (e.g., subject names) need to be
precise.
* **Backend Dependency** :Heavy reliance on model processing might cause performance
delays.
* **Limited Visual Feedback** :Reports and feedback are mostly text-based, with minimal
graphical summaries.
* **Keyword-based Feedback Limitations** :KeyBERT or basic NLP models can extract
misleading or irrelevant topics.
